# S3

Object Level Storage.
![s3](Pasted%20image%2020230703005304.png)

Changing a file:
- edit it and reupload entire file

## Overview
- Storage in buckets (Objects)
- **11 9s of durability** EXCEPT FOR ONE-ZONE-IA!
- Managed object cloud storage
- ~Unlimited storage

- Not assoc with a server
- Any type of object
- High bandwidth & storage
- Redundancy -> replicated across servers in the **same region.**

## Objects
- Any type of data file
- Supports objects up to the terabyte
	- DB Snapshots can be stored
- HTTP or HTTPS

## Access control
- IAM Policy
- S3 Bucket policy
- Per object ACL


## Tiers 
5 tiers are available
- Standard
	- Good for websites, cloud apps, big data analytics
- Intelligent Tiering
	- most $ effective tier
	- small monitoring and automation fee/obj
	- not accessed 30 days -> move to IA
	- move based on the usage of the data
- Standard-IA
	- Less frequent access, but rapid access when needed
	- Good for backups
- One-Zone-IA
	- Data is only stored in 1 AZ
	- $ less, but not as reliable/resilient
	- Secondary backup copies
- Glacier
	- low-cost for data archiving
	- retrieval: few mins ... few hours
- Glacier Deep Archive
	- lowest cost
	- long term retention (access once/twice yr)
	- For regulated customers that need to keep data for 7-10 years

## Analysis
- Event notifications (auto) when events occur
	- Set up/removal of buckets
	- Object removed/uploaded
- Send to you (SNS, etc) or trigger other services (e.g. Lambda)

### Storage Class Analysis
- Analyse patterns and transition to the right storage class
- e.g. If infrequent access pattern -> lifecycle age policy
- Daily visualisations of usage
- Export to an S3 bucket as well

## Encryption

## Usage
### Upload
- Create a bucket
- Upload objects
> Permissions can be set for data/metadata
### Endpoints
- path-style
- virtual hosted-style

## Redundancy & Scaling
- Data is stored/replicated across diff AZs in **the same region**
- durably store your data, even if there is concurrent data loss in two AWS facilities.

- Manages storage behind bucket as data grows
- Grows as app needs
- High vol of request, billed for usage only.

## Access
The usual methods:
- Mgmt console
- CLI
- SDK

> Obj keys must be url safe.


## Use cases
- App assets
- Static web host
- Backup
![Use cases](Pasted%20image%2020230703011034.png)
Backup and storage

– Provide data backup and storage services for others

Application hosting

– Provide services that deploy, install, and manage web applications

Media hosting

– Build a redundant, scalable, and highly available infrastructure that hosts video, photo, or music uploads and downloads

Software delivery

– Host your software applications that customers can download



## Pricing
Pay for what you use
- GB/mo
- Transfer OUT to **other regions**
- HTTP REST requests

No need to pay:
- inbound transfer
- S3 -> CloudFront/EC2 (same region)
