# AWS Cloud Foundations

This repository contains notes for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam.  
Please ignore the "Pasted image" in the root directory as there are images my editor (Obsidian) automatically added.  
The markdown files have been written in Obsidian, and it should be readable in GitHub's interface, but it would be good if you have Obsidian as some formatting is incompatible.(I may work on it when I have the time to)
